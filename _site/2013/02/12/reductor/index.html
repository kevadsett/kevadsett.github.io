        <div class="showcase-description"><p>The aim of this real-time multiplayer game is to reduce your blocks down to 0 before your opponent. It's controlled using the keyboard and mouse. You can only remove a block from the top of a column, so if your opponent has a block there, you'll have to wait for them to remove theirs before you can remove your own.</p>

<p>This game was my first foray into the world of <a href="http://www.backbonejs.org" target="_blank">Backbone.js</a>, as well as a platform for me to practice developing a multiplayer app using <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Nodejs</a>. I used <a href="http://socket.io/" target="_blank">Socket.io</a>, which seems like a brilliant little node add-on for any real-time interaction between multiple clients on a site.</p>

<p>The game was also a first for me in terms of using WebGL to do anything. Actually, as it turned out, <a href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank">THREE.js</a> is pretty much the only WebGL library you'll ever need. It's fantastic, and I'm looking forward to using it again some time.</p>

<p>All this technology was pretty new to me at the time (and some of it still kinda is!), but I think it all went quite well. The game itself is a little buggy, which mainly comes from not being able to test as two people playing at the same time! As for whether the game itself is fun to play, I think the jury's out on that one.</p>

<p>I really like the visual simplicity of the game, and you get a different colour scheme every match you play.</p>

<h4>Improvements that could be made:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Choose your opponent! At the moment, you join a game with the next consecutive person to enter the lobby. I think common multiplayer feature of host/join would be very welcome here.</li>
<li>Finishing the game! Yeah, so when you win... er... well done? Nothing happens!</li>
<li>Pick your colours! It'd be nice if you could choose your own colour scheme when 'hosting' a game</li>
</ul>
