		            <h1>Issue 2, chapter 1: Missing, presumed...</h1>
		            <div class="post-content"><p>Two weeks have passed since the events of the mountainous mutant fungus creature - dubbed by the media as The Blob. Power is still very intermittent, although hospitals, banks, government and other municipal buildings are all being given priority supply by the offshore substation which was saved that evening - not that any of the little amount of news coverage that has been available knows anything about that particular good deed.</p>

<p>The only news chopper footage in circulation shows the thing springing up from the power station, the lights in the city plunging into darkness as it breaks through the walls and bursts from building like bread rising from a tin. All the remaining members of the of the unusual band of heroes had seen the footage a hundred times already: the creature suddenly concentrating on a tall thin man in a grey suit – a man the others had come to know as Cass, the tanker hurtling up Curfel Road towards the par, the explosion that vapourised both beast and man.</p>

<p>The driver of the truck, a man named Hank Lenster, had been interviewed, talking about the hijack of his vehicle that saved his life and saved the city.</p>

<p>Switchboard had relayed the information that for a couple of weeks: none of the team were to contact each other. If anyone learned that a team, put together by the government, was right in the middle of the events (even if they did save the day), then the purpose of the team, to bring heroes back into a favourable light in the eyes of the country's public, would have been wasted. So none of the men have spoken to her, Piker or each other since that night. Begrudgingly, Rough Justice had agreed to Sledgehammers persistence on spending time together, and had let the big man stay in his trailer, and the two weeks had passed without incident.</p>

<p>Each of the group had receieved a similar note to that which had summoned them together the first time, this time signed by Colonel James Piker. It instructed them to return to the flat where they had all met, and gave a time and date.</p>

<p>The small front room of the flat has been somewhat transformed since the last time. A computer terminal now sits in the corner, an operative working on it, headphones on. The information on screen appears to be some kind of database. Switchboard sits in her favourite seat in the window alcove, and grins and waves at each of the men as they enter. First comes Fade, who doesn't use the door. He curls into existance by the doorway in a wisp of purple and black tendril-like smoke. Shortly afterwards, Max Tuesday, the unusual metallic man enters and drones an emotionless greeting at the assembly. Lastly Sledgehammer and Rough Justice enter noisily, completing the lineup. Fade notes to himself that Switchboard has bounced back remarkably well from The Event. The memory of her, quiet and terrified, plays back in his mind as he takes a seat.</p>

<p>A map of the world is pinned to one of the walls, a pin stuck in four locations, three in America, one in the middle east.</p>

<p>Once the men are seated, Colonel Piker addresses them. "Gentlemen, welcome back. Firstly I want to thank you for laying low the past couple of weeks. The last thing we need is the media jumping further onto the ‘we hate heroes' band wagon, but there's been a real positive vibe in the responses to the Event so far. Right now we need to redouble our efforts on the campaign to get heroes the recognition they deserve. Right now, the public aren't ready for you, but we've made more of a step in the right direction in the last couple of weeks than we have at all up to this point. I've no doubt by now that you've heard about the mysterious disappearances of four people the day before the Event. None of the vicitms were alone when they vanished, three of the four were in public. We've worked up these profiles." The Colonel hands each of the men four sheets of paper, each with a photo of the victim and a little information about them, plus a report of what happened up to the disappearance:</p>

</div>




<div class="blog-mm-disappearance-victim">
    <strong>Name</strong>: Julia Mendal.<br/>
    <strong>Age</strong>: 38.<br/>
    <strong>Occupation</strong>: TV Personality - Incarcerated.<br/>
    <strong>Background</strong>: Troubled childhood: alcoholic mother, abusive father - seemingly turned her life around and was making a successful career in TV. Ms Mendal witnessed first-hand the adultery of her fiancée, and something within her snapped. She brutally murdered her fiancée and his lover, stabbing them both to death with a kitchen knife. Acknowledges what she has done, and wants no forgiveness.<br/>
    <strong>Details</strong>: <br/>
    Was to be given newer, all-in-one lethal injection within the hour. Had been transported to the facility where the deed was to be carried out. Was strapped to table when the disappearance occurred. Authorities were notified immediately. CCTV is available.
</div>


<p>The group look through the files for a time, and after a while, Rough Justice asks about Julia Mendal's injection.</p>

<p>"All-in-one lethal injection? Is there a different kind?"</p>

<p>Max Tuesday buzzes back,</p>

<p>"Standard procedure in states which allow Capital Punishment is the administration of three injections, one anaesthetic, one to stop breathing, and one to stop the heart."</p>

<p>"He's right", says Piker, "but this is a more efficient and cheaper way to do the job, and was sanctioned by the Government earlier this year. Ms Mendal was due to be one of the first inmates in the country to receive this new drug."</p>

<p>As the group around the table discusses the victims, the door opens once again and in the doorway stands the ragged frame of Kasakhepra, or Cass, as he's known to the men around the table. Switchboard gasps, and Rough Justice jumps up from his seat, shouting,</p>

<p>"What the...?" But no further words spring to mind, so he just gawps.</p>

<p>"HELLO", booms Sledgehammer cheerfully. "YOU'RE A BIT LATE". The fact that he witnessed Cass get vapourised by a fireball two weeks earlier seems to have slipped his mind for the moment. Seeing the remaining seat waiting for him, Cass sits down.</p>

<p>"Thanks for joining us. I trust it found you." Says Piker to Cass, as pushing him a copy of the documents. Now that he's in the light of the room, the others in the group can see that Cass is not looking well at all. He's wearing dark glasses and a similar suit to the one he had been wearing the night they had seen him die. Black veins line his face and hands and he appears weaker and more frail than before.</p>

<p>Slightly uncomfortable in the astounded gaze of those in the room, Cass says shortly, "Continue."  Only two people in the room don't look surprised to see him. One of them has a metal face, and the other is Colonel Piker.</p>

<p>"We have since obtained footage of each event, which Corporal Daniels will show you in due course." He says, gesturing towards the man at the computer terminal.</p>

<p>"Sir", says Daniels suddenly. "Sorry to interrupt your briefing but you asked me to keep an eye on the bank situation. There's been a development sir. It's not just us, it's everywhere. We're up to 9 Countries now Sir." Piker looks rattled.</p>

<p>"I had hoped to contain this early, but things are moving fast. We have a situation. So far it hasn't leaked, and we aim to keep it that way, but an hour ago we had a report of what initially sounded like a bank robbery. However, no break-in attempt was made, but money has gone. What we thought was an isolated incident quickly revealed itself to be something more."</p>
