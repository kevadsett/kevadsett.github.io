This was my fastest coding challenge to date. My brother called me up and asked me for an app that he needed that evening, and gave me the following specifications:

 * Counts down from 1000 (configurable) at a given speed in beats per minute (BPM)
 * points can be deducted for three different reasons: player is wrong, player passes, or player uses a clue
 * bpm is dynamic
 * can be played/paused

My challenge was to do this in an hour during my lunch break and a further hour when I got home. I am pretty pleased with the result, and so was he!
