blurb: A GUI for the WebAudio API

My current project is to create a HTML5 canvas-based GUI for the WebAudio API. I find it works best on Chrome. It's called WebSynth2 because my first attempt didn't go very well!

Currently, I'm tackling filters, which is proving a little tricky. Right now I'm getting a lot of distortion on the output if you change to anything other than the default settings.
