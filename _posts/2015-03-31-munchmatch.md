March's [1 Game A Month](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) theme was 'Transform' and so the caterpillar transforms in both colour and size as you play this game, made using the [Phaser](http://phaser.io) framework. The basic premise here is 'Snake' meets match-3 in my most completed project to-date.

The match three mechanic works less well here as in traditional match-3 games the rows are in two dimensions, whereas here there is just the single dimension - the caterpillar's body. 

I particularly enjoyed making the sounds for this game, all done using my own voice and hands.
