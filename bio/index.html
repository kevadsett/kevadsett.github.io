<div class="bio-text">
    <p>I was born, raised, educated and now currently live and work in the City Of Brighton And Hove in sunny South East England.</p>
    <p>I have played videogames forever, but I tend to veer towards Sony's machines, having owned all the current PlayStations so far. I also like to try and make little games, you can see some examples on my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio page</a>. I am a co-host of TheSixthAxis podcast from Oscar Mike Media, which covers videogames, comics and movies. You can find that at <a href="http://www.thesixthaxis.com/list/?type=podcasts" target="_blank">thesixthaxis.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Designing and developing games is one of the most rewarding ways I choose to spend my time. Games as a medium, especially videogames, have the ability to really connect with people in a non-linear fasion, creating experiences that are hard to emulate in other media. When developing games, there's a real creative rush to be had in seeing an idea become a real game having started from scratch.</p>
    <p>Aside from coding - I love to make music, and I've been in a few bands throughout my life (and had a variety of hairstyles to match!). I play guitar, keys and sing a little too, as well as enjoying the production side of music too. You can have a listen to some of the stuff I've made using the soundcloud link on this page.</p>
