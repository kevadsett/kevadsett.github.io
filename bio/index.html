    <p>I was born, raised, educated and now currently live and work in the City Of Brighton And Hove in sunny South East England.</p>
    <p>I have played videogames forever, but I tend to veer towards Sony's machines, having own all the current PlayStations so far. I also like to try and make little games, you can see some examples on my portfolio page. I am a co-host of the popular videogames, comics and movies podcast from Oscar Mike Media, available at <a href="http://www.thesixthaxis.com/list/?type=podcasts" target="_blank">thesixthaxis.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Programming is one of the most rewarding ways I choose to spend my time. Seeing something become a real product or solution, having started from scratch is something very few professions outside of coding jobs get to achieve, and I find it has some similarities to other creative endeavours ,like painting a picture or composing a song. For me, programming can be just as creative and enjoyable as those things.</p>
    <p>Aside from code - I love to make music, and I've been in a few bands throughout my life (and had a variety of hairstyles to match!). I play guitar, keys and sing a little too. You can have a listen if you like, using the soundcloud link on this page.</p>
