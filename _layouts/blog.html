            <p>I run a (semi) regular superhero role-playing session (we play <a href="http://www.mutantsandmasterminds.com/" target="_blank">Mutants and Masterminds</a> by Green Ronin). After each session, I try to write up what's happened in a more creative way for posterity, and because it's really cool for the players to read back in more of a story-telling fashion, the decisions they've made to help the story along.</p>
